# Skoda-Fabia---analysis-of-sales-offers
Analysis of skoda fabia sales offers, based on scraped data from the auction site 

Tools used in this project:

pandas           : 1.1.3

matplotlib       : 3.3.2

selenium         : 3.141.0

seaborn          : 0.11.0


Using very simply web scraper, I downloaded about 900 Skoda Fabia offers.
Made analyse to find voivodeship with lowest price mean, using pandas in jupyter notebook.


Close future plans:
- make some charts


Update:
- prepared data to use with linear regression model ( standarization and label encoding)
- added scikit-learn lib to predict car price but model score is very bad ( need more data or prepare them in better way)
